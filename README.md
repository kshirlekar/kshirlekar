### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Kalyanee Shirlekar
## Bioinformatician

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a bioinformatic scientist with a passion for solving biological problems through computational methods. As an ex-bench scientist, I am eager to bridge gap between computational scientists and biologists. I've had the opportunity to work on various projects and develop a diverse set of skills in the dynamic and evergrowing field of genomics, transcriptomics and data visualization. 

### About Me

- **Name:** Kalyanee Shirlekar
- **Location:** Gainesville
- **Email:** kshirlekar@ufl.edu
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalyanee-shirlekar/

### Expertise

- **Bioinformatics:** I specialize in developing and executing bioinformatics pipelines such as RNA-Seq, Chip-Seq, ATAC-Seq, scRNA-Seq. I am accustomed with the Nexflow pipelines, and other bioinformatics tools, packages and genome browsers. My programming expertise lies in R and Python as well as basic level bash scripting. 
- **Machine Learning:** I am highly interested in appplying machine learning techniques to study biological conditions implicated in precision medicine.
- **Data Visualization** I am comfortable in Rshiny and love to experiment with different visualizations that can aid data interpretation.
- **Genomics/Precision Medicine:** Having worked as a Variant Analyst/Biocurator for 4 years, I am well-versed with fundamentals of clinical cancer biology, clinical trial design and management, classification of cancer types (SNOMED CT terms), guideline recommendations e.g. NCCN/FDA and the importance of targeted therapies in personalized medicine.

### Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. **RShiny Applications:** I am working on developing my RShiny skills by creating competant and visualing compelling dashboards that will be simply the analysis part of the transcriptome sequence datasets.
2. **R-Cheat-Sheet:** I am creating a cheat sheet for regular users of R where there are some code snippets you require for each and every R/RMD/ShinyApp file you develop. All you have to do is look for this repository and fork out the piece of code you need.
