### Hi there 👋

# Kalyanee Shirlekar
## Bioinformatician

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a bioinformatic scientist with a passion for modelling biological problems. I look at a new project as an opportunity to refine my skills. My skillset spans across various assays: RNA-Seq, scRNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq, Cut&Run, Cut&Tag, HiC, spatial RNA-Seq (10x Visium/Xenium), CRISPR-KO screens etc. I am also a machine learning scientist and enjoy working on projects in my past time. 

### About Me

- **Name:** Kalyanee Shirlekar
- **Email:** kshirlekar@ufl.edu / kalyanee.shirlekar@gmail.com
- **LinkedIn:** https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalyanee-shirlekar/

### Detailed Expertise

- **Bioinformatics:** I specialize in developing and implementing bioinformatics pipelines across transcriptomic, genomic, proteomic and metabolomic assays. I am accustomed with the Nexflow & Snakemake pipelines, and other bioinformatics tools, packages and genome browsers. My programming expertise lies in R and Python as well as basic level bash scripting. 
- **Data Visualization** I am comfortable in Rshiny and love to experiment with different visualizations that can aid data interpretation.
- **Genomics/Precision Medicine:** Having worked as a Variant Scientist for 4 years in precision oncology space, I am well-versed with fundamentals of clinical cancer biology, and class C medical device product development. 

### Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

1. **RShiny Applications:** I am working on developing my RShiny skills by creating competant and visualing compelling dashboards that will be simply the analysis part of the transcriptome sequence datasets.
2. **R-Cheat-Sheet:** I am creating a cheat sheet for regular users of R where there are some code snippets you require for each and every R/RMD/ShinyApp file you develop. All you have to do is look for this repository and fork out the piece of code you need.
